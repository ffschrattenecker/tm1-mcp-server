 * What a TI run is known to have done. The axis that matters to a caller is not
 * "did TM1 like it" but **was anything committed** — TM1's
 * `tm1.ExecuteWithReturn` answers HTTP 200 for every one of these.
 *
 * `ProcessExecuteStatusCode` has exactly six members (read from the `$metadata`
 * of both a v11 11.8 and a v12 12.5.9 server — identical, no version drift):
 * `CompletedSuccessfully`=0, `Aborted`=1, `HasMinorErrors`=2, `QuitCalled`=3,
 * `CompletedWithMessages`=4, `RollbackCalled`=5. They fall into three groups,
 * measured live on 11.8 through `ExecuteWithReturn` by writing a marker cell in
 * the Prolog, taking each exit path, and reading the cell back:
 *
 * - `succeeded`             — `CompletedSuccessfully`. Marker written.
 * - `completed_with_errors` — `CompletedWithMessages` (`ItemReject`),
 *   `QuitCalled` (`ProcessQuit`) and `HasMinorErrors` all left the marker cell
 *   **written**: the process ran and **its changes WERE COMMITTED**. Treat a
 *   blind retry as UNSAFE — the run already wrote data, so re-running can
 *   double-post it. All three are measured; on `HasMinorErrors` note that the
 *   DOCUMENTED path to it is per-record failures in the Metadata/Data tabs,
 *   which need a data source. It was reached here without one, from a pure
 *   Prolog, by writing to a consolidated element — same status code, and the
 *   earlier leaf write committed.
 * - `rolled_back`           — `Aborted` (`ProcessError`, or a `CellPutN` into a
 *   cube that does not exist) and `RollbackCalled` (`ProcessRollback`) both
 *   left the marker cell **rolled back**: the process ran, nothing was
 *   committed. Retrying is safe as far as commit state goes.
 * - `indeterminate`         — no `ProcessExecuteStatusCode` at all, a status
 *   code THIS BUILD DOES NOT KNOW (a seventh member added by a future TM1 must
 *   not be silently absorbed into a group whose commit semantics we never
 *   measured), or a call that errored before any status was reported. The run
 *   may have completed, partially completed, or never started. Defaulting this
 *   to `CompletedSuccessfully` (T-4) reported unverified runs as clean ones.
 *
 * Everything but `succeeded` travels with `success: false`, so the fail-closed
 * `isError` flags on `tm1_execute_process` / `tm1_save_data` keep firing;
 * `outcome` is what tells the three apart.
